NAME
    Compress::LZF_PP - A pure-Perl LZF decompressor

SYNOPSIS
      use Compress::LZF_PP;
      my $decompressed = decompress($compressed);
 
DESCRIPTION
    This module is a pure-Perl LZF decompressor. LZF is an extremely fast
    (not that much slower than a pure memcpy) compression algorithm. It is
    implemented in XS in Compress::LZF module. This is a pure-Perl LZF
    decompressor. Being pure-Perl, it is about 50x slower than
    Compress::LZF. Only use this if you can not use Compress::LZF.
